This course taught me about logic gates, Boolean algebra, and how to design circuits.
I finally understood how system in electrical and computer engineering works.
By using tools like Deeds Software and ETS-5000 Digital Training Kit to build and test circuits made the lessons practical and fun.
This course gave me a strong foundation in digital systems, and I’m excited to use what I’ve learned in future projects and studies.
